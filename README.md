Simple ESP8266 Webserver to send two digits to Arduino via a webpage


The Underlying code and cocepts were inspired and modifed from the source:
M. Thakur, "ESP8266 Node MCU Handling HTML web forms data | Circuits4you.com",     ……Circuits4you.com, 2019. [Online]. Available: https://circuits4you.com/2019/03/20/esp8266-.......receive-post-get-request-data-from-website/. [Accessed: 07- Mar- 2020].

When everything is set up you will be presented with two fields in the webpage where you can enter any didgits, these will then be sent to the aruino as the X-value and Y-value. 
This code was used in the Arduino Robot project.
